This is an internal docz [react-docgen](https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen) [handler](https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen#handlers) used to set `actualName` on React components.

Unless you're looking to contribute to docz, you probably don't care about this package and are looking for [the docz package documentation](https://github.com/doczjs/docz).
